#### --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---
<p>Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, 
and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect <span class="star">fifty stars</span> by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; 
the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants <span class="star">one star</span>. Good luck!

Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. 
He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

An opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

For example:

   - `(())` and `()()` both result in floor `0`.
   - `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor `3`.
   - `))(((((` also results in floor `3`.
   - `())` and `))(` both result in floor `-1` (the first basement level).
   - `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor `-3`.

To <span class="indicator">what floor</span> do the instructions take Santa?</p>

#### --- Part Two ---

<p>Now, given the same instructions, find the <span class="indicator">position</span> of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor `-1`). 
The first character in the instructions has position `1`, the second character has position `2`, and so on.

For example:

   - `)` causes him to enter the basement at character position `1`.
   - `()())` causes him to enter the basement at character position `5`.

What is the <span class="indicator">position</span> of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?</p>
